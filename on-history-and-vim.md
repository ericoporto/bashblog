On History and VIM

The command line is an effective way of getting things done. 
One of the things I like the most is how obvious are the tasks
that deserves being automated by just running the `history` command
and checking what you do most. 

I did some adjustments in my history, like making it twice as big as
default settings in Ubuntu. I operate the history a lot, mostly with 
`ctrl+r` in bash, and then I can use my brain to remember other things. 
When I am lazy I throw some `history | grep command I don't remember parameters`, 
`pandoc` and `tar` are good examples. Some git magic I usually anotate 
as a gist in github since I have a haystack of git commands in my 
history.

The thing about history is that once you deal with a lot, you
eventually will fall into having carefully written bash scripts that
make your work easier - like publishing a python lib to Python Package 
Index.

And while you are at the command line, I really recommend you to learn
**vim**, it's an awesome text editor that can be extended with many plugins.
My favorite right now is ZenRoom2, that can be called by typing `:Goyo`,
it will give you a confortable place to write texts distraction free.
