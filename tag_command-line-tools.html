On History and VIM
</a></h3>

<p>The command line is an effective way of getting things done. 
One of the things I like the most is how obvious are the tasks
that deserves being automated by just running the <code>history</code> command
and checking what you do most. </p>

<p>I did some adjustments in my history, like making it twice as big as
default settings in Ubuntu. I operate the history a lot, mostly with 
<code>ctrl+r</code> in bash, and then I can use my brain to remember other things. 
When I am lazy I throw some <code>history | grep command I don't remember parameters</code>, 
<code>pandoc</code> and <code>tar</code> are good examples. Some git magic I usually anotate 
as a gist in github since I have a haystack of git commands in my 
history.</p>

<p>The thing about history is that once you deal with a lot, you
eventually will fall into having carefully written bash scripts that
make your work easier - like publishing a python lib to Python Package 
Index.</p>

<p>And while you are at the command line, I really recommend you to learn
<strong>vim</strong>, it's an awesome text editor that can be extended with many plugins.
My favorite right now is ZenRoom2, that can be called by typing <code>:Goyo</code>,
it will give you a confortable place to write texts distraction free.</p>

Using Pandoc as a Markdown to Docx converter
</a></h3>

<p>So, I don't really like Word. But it's nearly unavoidable, 
especially in office environment (see what I did here?).</p>

<p>Word has some good things, it can be read and edited by most
people and can be easily converted to Kindle format. </p>

<p>So the command line:</p>

<pre><code>pandoc -o output.docx -f markdown -t docx input.md
</code></pre>

<p>Tadah! And if you are in Windows right now, one good thing is
that you can run pandoc without installing - doesn't require being
admin! <a href="
https://gist.github.com/ericoporto/ccf9547d9e4d0786113c">Also I've made a <code>.bat</code> for making this easier in Windows</a>. The bat
in action below: </p>

Cool Command Line Tools
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">March 01, 2016 &mdash; 
Erico Porto</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>So today I want to talk about the cool command line tools available today to make
your life living in the terminal easier!</p>

<h2>Nano</h2>

<p>This is old, but if you need a fast and quick text editor for not too long texts, this is 
what you want. For short texts, this is it!</p>

<h2>Slap Editor</h2>

<p>If you need to edit code, this is the closest to Sublime Text / Atom you will get on terminal.</p>

<p>It requires nodejs and npm installed. But having then and a internet connection will lead us
to the next one in this list...</p>

<h2>how2</h2>

<p>How2 is Google+Stackoverflow without needing to leave the confy place that is the terminal. 
It's really good for finding help using intuitive commands.</p>

<p>And that's it for today!</p>

<h3><a class="ablack" href="downloading-subtitles-by-the-command-line.html">
Downloading subtitles by the command line
</a></h3>
<div class="subtitle">March 17, 2016 &mdash; 
Erico Porto</div>
<!-- text begin -->

<p>Today I want to show you guys the awesome tool that's 
<a href="https://github.com/Diaoul/subliminal">Subliminal, by Diaoul</a>. Subliminal allow you to download a
subtitle for a downloaded series or movie by using the command line (did you bought Angry Video 
Game Nerd or PHD Movie and was surprised it had no subtitles in your language?).</p>

<p>First you have to install it. Assuming you have pip and python on your system:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install -U subliminal
</code></pre>

<p>After the instalation, you can use the follow command from command line to download a 
subtitle (I'm going to use brazilian portuguese):</p>

<pre><code>subliminal download -l pt-BR movie-filename.extension
</code></pre>

<p>And that's it! Use <code>-l en</code> for english subtitles. The software also has a Nautilus extension that
gives cool right click subtitle download for movie files - you can check on the project's webpage
on github.</p>

<p>I just use the command line, right now trying to bake a script to automate subtitle downloading. </p>
