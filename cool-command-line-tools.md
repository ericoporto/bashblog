So today I want to talk about the cool command line tools available today to make
your life living in the terminal easier!

Nano

This is old, but if you need a fast and quick text editor for not too long texts, this is 
what you want. For short texts, this is it!

Slap Editor
-----------

If you need to edit code, this is the closest to Sublime Text / Atom you will get on terminal.

It requires nodejs and npm installed. But having then and a internet connection will lead us
to the next one in this list...

How2 is Google+Stackoverflow without needing to leave the confy place that is the terminal. 
It's really good for finding help using intuitive commands.

And that's it for today!
